hello there.

new site, new stack, fresh start.

i recently migrated this site from **[zola](https://www.getzola.org)** to **[astro](https://astro.build)**. zola was great — fast builds, simple templating, and a solid experience overall. but over time, it started to feel limiting for what i wanted to build next.

astro, on the other hand, feels like a serious upgrade. first-class markdown support, component integration, and solid performance make it a great fit for building a modern site. tailwind just works, and the development flow feels smooth and flexible — minimal when i need it, capable when i push it.

was it necessary? maybe not. but it opens doors — and it feels right.

this marks the first post on the new stack. i’ll be sharing thoughts, technical deep dives, and maybe a few terminal tricks i’ve picked up along the way.

more to come.
